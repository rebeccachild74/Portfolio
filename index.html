                        Hello! My name is Rebecca, and I'm an aspiring Software Developer with a passion for problem solving and empowering women in STEM. Currently, my interests include Machine Learning, Desktop Applications, and Cloud Services. I am set to graduate the Washington State University's Everett campus in December of 2020 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Mathematics. Outside of school, I work as a Computer Science tutor at Everett Community College, serve as Secretary to both SWE and the ACM, and work on artwork. I hope to enter the technology industry as an intern this summer and find a fullfilling full time position upon graduation. Thank you for taking the time to view my site! As this is my first shot at web dev, any feedback is appreciated via the <a href="#contact">contact</a> form below.

                At WSU Everett I am the Secretary of The Association for Computing Machinery, where we are currently planning our first hackathon! I am also a member and former Secretary of the Society of Women Engineers. I have completed several core CS classes such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Database Management. Our curriculum also contains several Software Design courses where we learn about different process models, requirement gathering techniques, and Testing techniques among other things.

                        	My capstone team and I are working with a mentor from Expedia Partner Services on a website traffic monitoring system. Currently, EPS's parter sites have to report to EPS when their site is having issues. With our system, failures will be detected and the respective dev teams will be notified. We are following Software Engineering processes such as requirements gathering and modeling the design. We will be building a Machine Learning Model that updates real-time using Jupyter Notebook and SageMaker. Currently the team is employing Scrum techniques to manage workload. I am the project liaison and create meeting agendas to ensure the team is on task and meets all deadlines.

                            I worked with two other team members over the course of 6 months to design and implement a Desktop Yelp Application. We designed and implemented a PostgreSQL relational database that successfully maintains over 3 million yelp data entries from the 2013 “Yelp Dataset Challenge.” This database was hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. Our final application featured a responsive UI with 2 different user portals for business admins and users for their separate use cases.

                            I programmed a desktop Winform application that contains much of the same features as Excel using multiple design patterns for an Object Oriented Programming class. Highlight capabilities include undoing/ redoing actions and saving/ loading spreadsheets.  iteratively added functionality to application to meet all the project requirements by the deadline. Throughout this process I adhered to the StyleCop style guide containing over 500 rules to create consistent and readable code. Throughout the course and iterations I added Unit, Integration, and System tests to ensure the quality of the software.
